Virtualmin docker image:

docker run -dit --privileged --restart unless-stopped -h [hostname] --name=vmin --dns=127.0.0.1 --dns=[gateway ip/external DNS] -p 20:20 -p 21:21 -p 2222:22 -p 25:25 -p 53:53 -p 80:80 -p 110:110 -p 111:111 -p 143:143 -p 443:443 -p 587:587 -p 993:993 -p 995:995 -p 3306:3306 -p 10000:10000 -p 20000:20000 -p 38532:38532 -p 40259:40259 cutech/docker-virtualmin

This is still a work in progress (I've only tested this with debian:stretch), you can use the Dockerfile or Docker/Rancher compose.

The Rancher version sets the /home and /usr/share/webmin/virtual-server/scripts/ directories as sidekick volumes for ease in backup and customization of scripts.

You may need to enter the Virtualmin container to start the Virtualmin server 

	docker exec -it [container-ID] /bin/bash
		[root@CaCrOS rancher]# service webmin start
		
The docker-compose.yml command *should* have removed the comments from the /etc/resolv.conf added DNS servers, if not you will have to do it by hand with nano/vi (sed wont do it).

Go to https://your.external.fqdn:10000 and login to the contol panel as root

Right-click on the Webmin tab in the upper left of the control panel and allow webmin popup, reload webmin modules (Checking for usable Webmin modules .. .. found 76 with installed applications, 47 not installed.), reload page, open the servers entry

Go back to the Virtualmin tab and finish the configuation;

Preload Virtualmin libraries? Yes
